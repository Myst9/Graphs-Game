This is a 5 member project done as a part of our Software Engineering Lab held by Dr. Sridhar Chimalakonda. 
<br><br><br>
The theme of this project was Computing, Collaboration and Communication (CCC). We chose to make a game that explains the fundamental concepts underlying complex Graph Algorithms, thus making it fun to learn them without being intimidated.

<br>
The algorithms we chose were: 
<br> <br>
<ol>
<b> Dijkstra's Algorithm: Algorithm to find shortest path</b><br>
<b> DFS : Search Algorithm</b><br>
<b> BFS : Search Algorithm </b><br>
<b> Ford Fulkerssen : Algorithm to find maximum flow in a network</b>
</ol>
<br><br>
We made a <b> 3D URP </b> game using Unity and CSharp(C#) to achieve this goal. Our game is divided into 4 chapters, each explaining one of the aforementioned algorithms without explicitly telling so.
